# NDVI-QGIS-Agricultural-Analysis
NDVI based agricultural area analysis with Sentinel-2 satellite images using QGIS

#NDVI-QGIS-Agricultural-Analysis 🌾🛰️

This project aims to analyze the plant health of agricultural areas by calculating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) on QGIS using Sentinel-2 satellite images.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To interpret plant health by calculating NDVI from satellite images
- To identify weak and strong development zones in agricultural areas
- To produce visual and numerical output

## 🔧 Tools Used
- QGIS 3.x
- Sentinel-2 L2A data (via Copernicus Hub)
- Raster calculator
- (Optional) Python raster operations, Google Earth Engine

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `/data` - Satellite data or links
- `/docs` - Map visuals, analysis results
- `QGIS_Project.qgz` - QGIS project file
- `ndvi_calc_steps.md` - Calculation steps

## 📌 Note
This repo is a reference for both learning and real analysis projects.
